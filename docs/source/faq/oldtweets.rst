Does ThinkUp archive old tweets/posts, or just present and future ones?
=======================================================================

ThinkUp does everything it can to go back and capture historical tweets and posts, but it is subject to API limitations
of the services it crawls.

For example, Twitter currently only allows API access to the last 3,200 tweets in your history. If you've tweeted
more than 3,200 times, ThinkUp will only capture your last 3,200 tweets and every new tweet going forward.
