Can I add more than one Twitter, Facebook, or Google+ account to ThinkUp?
=========================================================================

Yes. You can add as many Twitter accounts and/or Facebook profiles and pages and/or Google accounts as you want to a
single ThinkUp installation. For performance reasons, we recommend you don't add more than six accounts to one
installation, especially if one or more of the accounts are busy and have a lot of data associated with them.

ThinkUp requires that you authorize the addition of these accounts by providing the right credentials to log into
them, i.e., you cannot add an account if you don't have a valid username and password for it.
