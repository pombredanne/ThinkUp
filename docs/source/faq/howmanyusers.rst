How many service user accounts can you add to a ThinkUp installation?
=====================================================================

We recommend you don't add more than 6 Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or other service user accounts to a given ThinkUp
installation. More accounts than that will blow up ThinkUp's database to large proportions which could make it slow
to respond and difficult to upgrade.

If you've added more than 6 accounts to your ThinkUp installation and performance has degraded,
