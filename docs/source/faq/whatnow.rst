I downloaded ThinkUp to my computer, but I don't know how to install it. What do I do now?
==========================================================================================

ThinkUp doesn't run on your desktop computer like a regular application. You'll need a web server to install and run it.
Typically users purchase a web hosting plan and install ThinkUp on it the same way they'd install WordPress.

ThinkUp developers have documented how to install ThinkUp
on `Windows <https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp/wiki/Installation:-Windows>`_ and
`Mac OS X <https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp/wiki/Installation:-Mac-OS-X>`_ on the community wiki.
