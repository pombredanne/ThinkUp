Beta 0.7 - 27 Dec 2010
======================

**New:**

*   Improved login security: To avoid the potential for brute-force
    password cracking attempts on ThinkUp's login page, there is now a cap
    on the number of failed logins. After 10 failed login attempts, a
    ThinkUp users's account gets deactivated. To reactivate, the user
    resets his/her password via email. (Look for more security-focused
    updates to the system in future releases.)

*   Better retweet crawling: Thanks to Amy, ThinkUp now captures
    the total of new-style retweets more accurately, and displays that
    number plus the number of old-style quoted retweets that ThinkUp
    detects.

*   Tweet reply links: Thanks to Sam, you can now easily reply to a
    given tweet from inside ThinkUp. Rollover any tweet and click on the
    "Reply" link to autofill Twitter's update form with the user name and
    status ID. Screenshot:

*   Picplz support: Thanks to Kyle, photos posted on Twitter from
    http://picplz.com now show up as inline thumbnails in ThinkUp.

*   Tweet photo thumbnails appear on post page: Speaking of image
    thumbnails, they now appear on individual post pages like this one:

*   Configure number of links to expand per crawler run: Thanks to
    Sam, you can now set the number of links the Expand URLs plugin
    attempts per crawler run. This number is 1500 by default and normally
    won't need to be changed. But, if your crawls are taking too long or
    if you've got too many links to expand that aren't happening fast
    enough, you can now dial it up or down in the web interface.

*   Followers/Who You Follow lists updated: Twitter's Followers/Who
    You Follow lists have been simplified, and now display some
    interesting stats like how many multiples of followers a user has
    versus friends, and the average number of posts that user has
    published per day since they joined Twitter. Screenshot:

*   New (for developers)! Logger debug mode: Thanks to Amy, developers
    who have debug=true in their config file can write debug statements to
    the log while developing the crawler.

**Fixed:**

*   Gradients in design refresh: Thanks to Andy, everyone on
    every browser sees the new gradients in beta 6's design refresh as we
    intended.

*   Upgrader: Mark fixed a bug that potentially caused problems
    upgrading to ThinkUp's latest version from beta 2. We now have
    automated upgrade tests which run through every single possible
    upgrade path from beta 1 to beta 7 passing.

*   Several more little things: Application options
    have been moved to the generic options table to consolidate our data
    structure; Update your data links no longer throw a 404; Links to
    retweet listings from the Dashboard have been corrected; Plugin
    external libraries are now located in their own extlib folders.
