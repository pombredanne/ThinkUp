Beta 0.6 - 13 Dec 2010
======================

**New:**

*   Favorite tweets: Thanks to an incredible show of perseverance
    by Amy who has been shepherding along this branch since April, ThinkUp
    now captures your favorite tweets (the ones you have starred) and
    lists them under a new Favorites menu on the main dashboard. If you
    like to star tweets with links in them for reading later, you can
    filter your favorites list that way, too. Screenshot:

*   Design refresh: Anil made a few design improvements in this
    release which consolidate the header and status bar, make the sidebar
    menu easier to see and use, remove lots of borders and other clutter,
    and make the replies and retweets buttons more button-like. See the
    new design in action:

    Note: there are rough spots and CSS/markup mistakes here; I modified
    several of Anil's tweaks so anything that's broken/weird is probably
    my fault. As always, we'll be polishing as we go. CSS mavens, send me
    pull requests with fixes, please. (Please.)

*   Reorganized post page: The post detail page now has a sidebar
    menu just like the dashboard does, a one-stop shop for everything you
    can do with a post, like export replies, search and filter replies,
    list retweets, and see responses on a map. Like the dashboard, plugins
    generate this menu dynamically, which opens the door to
    conversation-specific visualizations and reply listings. Now that the
    stage is set for those kinds of plugins, expect to see more items
    appear in that menu in future releases. Screenshot:

*   Expand/collapse advanced plugin options: A ThinkUp plugin can
    potentially have several settings, and many of them could have default
    values that most users don't need to ever see or change. That's why
    we've set up the ability to hide "advanced" plugin options to simplify
    setup. For example, the only options an admin sees by default for the
    Twitter plugin are the two required values, the rest are nestled away
    comfortably in a hidden div. Just click "Show Advanced Options" to
    reveal them. Screenshot:

**Fixed:**

*   Twitter inquiries: Thanks to Andy, tweets which contain URLs
    that have question marks in them no longer show up in the Inquires
    list, because they're not questions.

*   New developers tools! Developers can now output custom debugging
    lines while running tests, run an individual test in a given TestCase,
    and see details of a database access error when they set debug = true
    in the config.inc.php file.

*   More little things: Fixed a bug where under certain
    conditions, a user may not get saved to the database correctly. Fixed
    a bug where the web-based crawler page's content-type was not set
    correctly. Fixed a bug where an instance may not get updated correctly
    after a crawl completes. Added a link to the IRC channel to the
    application footer.
