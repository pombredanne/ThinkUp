Beta 0.5 - 22 Nov 2010
======================

**New:**

*   Human readable crawler log: When you click on the "Update now"
    link to run the ThinkUp crawler, the activity log you'll see has been
    totally revamped. You'll have an easier time seeing errors, successes,
    and information about what's working and what's not.

*   Better data integrity: The latest database migration enforces
    some unique indexes which will make sure your datastore is cleaner and
    free of duplicate links and posts. (Related mailing list thread:

**Fixed:**

*   Reduced number of Twitter API errors: The order the ThinkUp
    crawler gathers your data from the Twitter API has been adjusted in a
    way that should result in fewer errors and faster data capture. In
    practice, your friends and followers lists will not stay empty for as
    long as they have been anymore. (One of several related mailing list
    threads: http://groups.google.com/group/thinkupapp/browse_thread/thread/cfb9735d6e2ada39/8902e1903b0974ac)

*   The database upgrader: The upgrader now supports custom table
    prefixes (Guillaume, you will be the true test of this fix), and it
    has more understandable messaging about what to do regarding the
    completion email and after the upgrade is complete. (Related mailing
    list messages: http://groups.google.com/group/thinkupapp/msg/021fb00f8f51881e

*   Expand URLs hanging bug: The ExpandURLsPlugin used to hang
    indefinitely when it hit a URL that didn't respond quickly enough,
    causing some people to have to deactivate the plugin entirely. The
    timeout has been set so the plugin will move on after a set amount of
    time correctly now.

*   A few more little things: The grid search now works with
    posts which contain Unicode characters, and plugin option errors no
    longer have the endearing but completely uninformative "Sorry, but we
    are unable to process your request at this time" message--instead, you
    get specific details about what's wrong. (Related mailing list thread:
