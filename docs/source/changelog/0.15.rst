Beta 0.15 - 30 Aug 2011
=======================

**New features:**

*   Capture Facebook media: Store and display Facebook post links titles, images, descriptions, and captions
*   Capture Facebook "likes": Store and display Facebook post "likes" and sort posts by most-liked, this week and all
    time
*   Capture Facebook friends' location (when permitted) so that the Geoencoder plugin can plot Facebook replies on a
    Google Map
*   Add "Recent Activity" dashboard chart: A post-by-post bar chart of replies and likes/retweets

**Improvements:**

*   Upgrade Facebook plugin to OAuth 2.0 for more secure authorization flow 
*   Improve login security: Enable database-stored per-user password salt (instead of hard-coded single salt)
*   Improve t.co support: The ExpandURLs plugin gracefully handles  multiple-shortened URLs, like a t.co link which
    shortens a bit.ly or instagr.am link
*   On a fresh installation, enable the Twitter, Facebook, and Expand URLs plugins by default
*   Add configurable "cache_lifetime" value to the config.inc.php file to reduce database load on busy installations
*   Sped up dashboard render time by aggressively caching query output to file
