Beta 0.3 - 19 Oct 2010
======================

**New:**

*   Delete network accounts: If you've added a Twitter or Facebook
    account you want to delete, there's now a handy "Delete" button to do
    so, as shown here:

*   User-selected timezone: When you install ThinkUp fresh, a
    dropdown of timezones is available for you to choose from, instead of
    the app just defaulting to America/Los_Angeles. This will fix the
    infamous "updated thousands of negative seconds ago" bug that appears
    in the status bar on new installations not located in Southern
    California. Existing users: you should enter your timezone correctly
    by hand into your config.inc.php.
    Warning: the timezone select in the installer is long and scary right
    now. There is an issue filed (#369) to simplify it.

*   Installer attempts to create database: When you install ThinkUp
    fresh, if you enter the name of a database which does not already
    exist, the installer will attempt to create it with the credentials
    you enter. Previously it required that the database already existed.

**Fixed:**

*   Facebook Plugin: Fixed major bugs with new Facebook
    application setup; you can now authorize your FB account and add pages
    you like to ThinkUp with the correct permissions.

*   E_STRICT warnings: If you've got PHP warning set to E_STRICT,
    ThinkUp no longer triggers warnings while developing.

**Refactored:**

*   In preparation for Twitter's new 64-bit "Snowflake" post
    IDs, we've expanded the capacity of ThinkUp's post ID fields.

*   Ported several tests to use our FixtureBuilder library
    instead of raw SQL. The FixtureBuilder lets you create test data very
    easily and using it throughout our tests instead of straight SQL will
    enable us to swap in different DB types and test with custom table
    prefixes later.
