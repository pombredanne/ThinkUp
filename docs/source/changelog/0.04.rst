Beta 0.4 - 14 Nov 2010
======================

**New:**

*   Web-based database upgrader: When you install the new version,
    you'll experience the biggest new ThinkUp feature, our web-based
    database upgrader. Instead of running SQL by hand to update your
    ThinkUp datastore, the app will walk you through the process step by
    step, show you what changes it made, and even give you an option to
    back up your data first. Screenshots here:

    This new feature is big and complicated and while we tried our best to
    test every possible scenario, we're depending on you to let us know
    how it goes and report any problems you may have or make any UX
    suggestions. (Thanks in advance for that.)

*   Configurable Twitter API error tolerance: The Twitter API
    serves many fail whales. You can now configure the crawler to tolerate
    up to a certain number of whales--5 by default, but you can increase
    or reduce it now in the plugin settings.

**Fixed:**

*   Crawler log updates as-it-runs: The "Update now" page updates
    in real-time, instead of spinning and spinning until an entire crawler
    run is complete.

*   Lots of little things: no more exec() PHP warning, the
    WordPress plugin instructions and DB calls are fixed, long URLs now
    wrap correctly, no more bug with deleted accounts because of caching,
    restored missing cache directory causing permissions error, added
    automatic tests for installation and upgrade process, ported several
    tests to the FixtureBuilder library.
