Beta 0.2 - 4 Oct 2010
=====================

*   Facebook Plugin: I gutted all the old Facebook Connect code and
    replaced it with shiny new Open Graph code. The account connection
    experience should be much less bewildering. Give it a try and let me
    know how it goes, especially all of you who have had trouble in beta
    1. Important note for those of you who actually did manage to set up
    Facebook users and pages successfully: the new plugin requires that
    you enter the Facebook Application ID, as shown here:

*   Twitter plugin: The Twitter API throws a lot of 500 errors (fail
    whales). Amy added a plugin option that lets you set how many whales
    the crawler should tolerate during a given crawl. Also, the crawler
    will now retry a failed API call instead of just moving onto the next
    one. Hopefully this will result in more successful Twitter crawls
    faster. Here's what the new option looks like:

*   Inquiries: See only posts that you've asked an actual question in,
    which often prompts more replies. There's no fancy natural language
    processing going on here, so it's not always perfect, but the new
    "Inquiries" post listing only displays posts that contain question
    marks. An example in action:

Beta 2 also contains several minor bugfixes that restore broken links,
tweak the design consistency, and remove a significant amount of code
that was no longer being used. (This is why the .zip file is smaller
than beta 1's was.)
