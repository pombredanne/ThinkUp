Beta 0.9 - 17 Mar 2011
======================

Twitter plugin:
---------------

*   Reduced Twitter API 502 errors
    When you run beta 9, you'll see a greatly reduced number of red
    Twitter API 502 errors in your crawler log. Turns out that if you
    request 200 tweets per Twitter API call, it often times out and issues
    a 502. Beta 9 only requests 100 tweets per call--which requires more
    calls, but results in fewer errors. The number of tweets your ThinkUp
    installation retrieves per API call is now configurable in the Twitter
    plugin's Advanced Settings area (though it's not something you should
    have to change unless you're troubleshooting or developing). More

*   Fixed Follower Count charts where there is missing data
    If there's a gap in the follower count data (meaning, your crawler
    hasn't run every day the chart represents), those gaps are now
    reflected properly on the X-axis of the follower count graphs on the
    Main Dashboard as well as on the Follower Count page. Screenshot:

*   Added Follower Count milestones
    Wondering how long it will take to reach 1,000 followers? 5,000
    followers? 100,0000 followers? Beta 9 adds a Follower count "next
    milestone" message that calculates how long it will take to reach the
    next level. Here's a screenshot of that in action:

*   Corrected Retweet count ceiling at 100 RTs
    Thanks to Amy, retweet counts are no longer capped at 100; if there
    are more than 100 retweets for a post, that's reflected in the UI.

*   Resolved Twitter favorites crawler problem
    If you have no favorites or Twitter is reporting an inaccurate number,
    the crawler handles that more gracefully.

*   Fixed follower deactivation bug
    If a follower account has been deactivated, ThinkUp's crawler doesn't
    count that as an error; rather it deactivates the relationship and
    moves on.


Facebook plugin:
----------------

*   Fixed broken Facebook avatar images
*   Facebook plugin now pages back to capture all comments on a status
    update, doesn't just get 25


Expand URLs plugin:
-------------------

*   Folded the Flickr Thumbnails plugin into the Expand URLs plugin
    You now set your Flickr API key in the Expand URLs settings; the
    database migration for beta 9 takes care of that for you.
