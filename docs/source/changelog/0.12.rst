Beta 0.12 - 17 May 2011
=======================

**New:**

*   User invitation system: If registration is closed to the public, an admin can :doc:`generate a user invitation
    link good for one user registration </userguide/settings/allaccounts>`
*   When there's a new version of ThinkUp available, a :doc:`notification will appear in the status bar
    </install/upgrade>` for a logged-in admin
*   Application setting to :doc:`disable JSON API access </userguide/settings/application>` (admins only)
*   Application setting to :doc:`set default service user to display </userguide/settings/application>` when visiting
    ThinkUp (admin-only)
*   Full support for servers running https://
*   Improved interface for switching service user, running the crawler, and reorganized the settings tabs to make it
    easier/clearer what does what
*   Added links to help documentation throughout the application

**Fixed:**

*   Invalid JSON returned by the Post API
*   SlickGrid export button no longer opens a new tab
*   Doesn't show :doc:`follower count history milestones </userguide/listings/twitter/dashboard_followers-history>`
    unless they're within 10 days, weeks, or months (i.e., no more "You will reach 1,000 followers in 954 weeks")
*   Deprecated the Embed Thread plugin and made it core functionality, with the option to disable it in
    :doc:`Settings > Application </userguide/settings/application>`
*   Multiple embedded ThinkUp threads on a given web page no longer overwrite each other; Added permalinks to
    embedded threads
*   Removed Twitter plugin former friends/followers and not mutual data listings (which didn't work anyway)

**IMPORTANT BACKWARD-COMPATIBILITY API CHANGE NOTICE**

Beta 12 will break any embedded ThinkUp threads from earlier versions. Please update any embed code you've published
on the web from earlier versions of ThinkUp.
