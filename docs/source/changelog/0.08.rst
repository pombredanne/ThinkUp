Beta 0.8 - 28 Jan 2011
======================

**New:**

*   Top 20 words
    My absolute favorite new ThinkUp feature is courtesy of Mark Wilkie:
    on any post that has more than 20 replies, click on the "Top 20 words"
    link in the sidebar menu. ThinkUp will display a summary of most
    frequently-used words in a reply set. Click on one to see all the
    replies which contain the word. Here's an example of Top 20 words in
    action:
    http://smarterware.org/thinkup/post/?t=25077429986&n=twitter

    Fun fact: This feature includes word stemming capabilities, so words
    like reply, replies, and replied all get grouped together. It uses the
    Snowball JavaScript library to do this. Fantastic work, Mark. Next up:
    phrase frequency, so the reply "Big Bang Theory" gets listed as one
    item in the example above.

*   Embed Thread plugin
    Copy and paste a bit of JavaScript into any web page to embed a post
    and set of replies sourced from ThinkUp. Activate the Embed Thread
    plugin in the Settings > Plugins area. Then click on "Embed Thread" on
    any post page to get the embed code. This plugin is a work in
    progress, so give it a try and let us know how it goes. A screenshot:

*   Web-based application-wide settings
    We're continuing to move as many ThinkUp settings out of the
    config.inc.php file and into the database as possible. In ThinkUp's
    Settings area, an admin can now click on the Settings tab to open or
    close the installation's registration page, and set reCAPTCHA keys as
    well. Screenshot:

    IMPORTANT NOTE: This setting has registration closed by default on all
    new installations and upgraded installations. It overrides anything
    that is currently listed in your config.inc.php file, meaning, it
    deprecates the $THINKUP_CFG['is_registration_open'] variable and
    reCAPTCHA keys set there. If registration is open on your ThinkUp
    installation right now, after you upgrade to beta 8, you MUST log in
    as an admin and check this box to explicitly reopen it and transfer
    your reCAPTCHA keys into the text fields there and save. Apologies for
    the aggressive change here, but we want everyone's installation to be
    closed/more secure by default.

*   Instagr.am support
    Thanks to Amy, all new Instagr.am images that the crawler encounters
    in beta 8 show up as thumbnails inline in ThinkUp's post listings.

*   Activate accounts from the web interface
    Thanks to Randi, if your installation's new account activation email
    is getting spammed, you can now log in as an admin and activate new
    user account by pressing an "Activate" button in the web interface.
    (You can also deactivate accounts as well.) In Settings, you'll see
    this button listed in the "All ThinkUp Accounts" tab.

*   Command line interface to backups and migrations
    Thanks to Mark, advanced users with large databases can now back up
    their ThinkUp installation and run potentially large/slow database
    migrations at the command line. (For example, one of beta 8's
    migrations changes the width of the tu_posts.post_text field; on my
    12M row table, this took over an hour.) To use the command line tools,
    SSH in your server and CD to ThinkUp's install/cli/ folder. There you
    can run php backup.php or php upgrade.php. The Upgrade script will
    show you the total time elapsed at the end of the migration. If the
    crawler is running when you attempt the migration, the upgrade process
    will let you know and tell you to try again later when the crawl
    process is complete.

**Fixed:**

*   Facebook posts no longer cut off
    Speaking of database migrations, Facebook posts, which can be up to
    420 characters in length, are no longer cut off due to the too-small
    size of ThinkUp's post_text field.

*   Twitter usernames linked correctly
    Thanks to suth's ninja regex skills, ThinkUp more accurately links
    Twitter user names, and doesn't do things like link a lone @ symbol
    mid-tweet.

*   Notification emails less likely to get spammed
    Thanks to Sam, email notifications from ThinkUp have the correct From:
    address set (using your web server's domain name), which makes those
    messages less likely to get shuttled into the spam folder.

*   Invalid Google Maps key error
    When a post is not geoencoded, you will no longer see a JavaScript
    alert about an invalid Google Maps key error when you click on the
    Response Map item in the GeoEncoder plugin menu.

*   Several more little things
    "ThinkUp is in the process of an upgrade" page no longer gets "stuck"
    in cache, JavaScript errors in the switch user dropdown have been
    resolved, the "Your ThinkUp Password" text fields no longer scroll, no
    more error messages when authorizing a Twitter account, the Copyright
    notice is now 2011, lists of links (your own and your friends)
    included the expanded version and now paginate.
