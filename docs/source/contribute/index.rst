==========

At ThinkUp, we know that software development isn't just about code. We're looking for writers, designers, power users, 
and user experience experts to collaborate with us to make a world-class platform. All are welcome. 

Where to Start
--------------

The most frequently-asked question we get from potential contributors is "Where do I begin?"  Our answer is always
"What are your skills? What are you most interested in working on?"

ThinkUp is just as much about community as it is about code, so if you're brand new, the first step is 
:doc:`contact us </contact>` and introduce yourself. Tell us what your skills are and what you're most
excited about in ThinkUp, and how you'd like to help. The community can help point you in the right direction.

sysadmins to help make ThinkUp as easily-installable and upgradable as possible. If you're interested in lending a 
hand, please do :doc:`get in touch </contact>`.
