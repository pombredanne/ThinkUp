Individual Post
===============

The individual post page offers several ways to view, search, export, share, and interact with a post and its replies.

Post Replies
------------

The default post page view, the Replies listing displays all the replies to the parent post. By default, the replies
listing is replies by the original post's author's friends first, then ordered by replier's follower count descending.

Search Replies (Logged-in only)
-------------------------------

To search a set of replies by keyword, type your keyword into the input box below "Post Replies" and click on the 
"Search" button.

To export a set of results to a CSV file for download, click on the "Export" button above the search results.

Embed Thread on an External Web Page
------------------------------------

You can share and publish a ThinkUp conversation by copying and pasting a bit of JavaScript into any web page. To do
so, on an individual post page, expand the post's metadata by clicking on the down arrow. Then, copy and paste the
JavaScript code available in the text box.

If a post is private or if the administrator has  :doc:`disabled embedding </userguide/settings/application>`, this
embed code will not be displayed on the post page.

.. warning::
    If you embedded a ThinkUp thread prior to beta 12, when you upgrade to beta 12 or greater those existing embeds
    will break. To fix them, visit the post's page in ThinkUp and replace the old embed code with the latest version.
    Apologies for this inconvenience. Beta 12 defines ThinkUp version 1.0's API, which will always be supported. All
    future major releases will be backwards-compatible to version 1.0's API.
