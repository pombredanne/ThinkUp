Conversations
=============

See back-and-forth tweet exchanges between you and other users in the Conversation view.

If you are signed into ThinkUp, you'll see replies to private replies; if not, you'll only see public exchanges.

.. admonition:: On the Roadmap

    Currently, conversation view only displays exchanges in pairs, a single tweet and a single reply. We hope to
    support multi-tweet exchanges that exceed a tweet and a single reply soon.
