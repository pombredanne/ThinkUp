Only showing 5000 results. Show all?
====================================

When you're searching large sets of data within ThinkUp, you may see the message "Only showing 5000 results. Show all?
(Can be slow)."

Since ThinkUp's search results functionality is JavaScript-based, the application limits how many results it returns
by default for performance reasons. To see more than the default number (5000), click on the "Show all" link. 

If the query returns a large amount of data, depending on the size of the dataset and the speed of your
server and local computer, see all the results can be a very slow operation.
