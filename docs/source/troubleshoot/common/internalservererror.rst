Internal Server Error, or blank page when loading ThinkUp
=========================================================

If loading ThinkUp shows a blank page, or you see an HTTP 500, you're likely experiencing an "Internal Server Error." 

To troubleshoot this problem, check your server's Apache error logs, which will contain details of exactly what's going
wrong. If you don't know where the error log is located on your web server, contact your web hosting provider to find
out.

Once you can see your web server error log, reload the ThinkUp page causing the error to see its details. :doc:`Send the
error line in your log to the ThinkUp community to troubleshoot </contact>`.
